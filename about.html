                    <p class="slideText">You know you’ve watched at least one. You may have hated yourself the whole time you did, but you definitely did. You got addicted to it, despite or maybe even because of how fucking inane it was. You had favorites. You definitely hated one guy. You cheered when a contestant you were rooting for got chosen for that thing…</p>

                    <p class="slideText">Can you imagine presenting one of those live? Because Chisa Hutchinson did. She’s calling it DATING COMPREHENSION. It’s a highly interactive, live-theater spoof of a competitive dating show. So fun. So fab. So deceptively frivolous.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mySlides fade" >
                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">After witnessing (and personally experiencing) many a ridiculous micro-aggression in the date-osphere, Chisa felt compelled to use this show as a tool to offer up sly commentary on classism, racism, gender inequality and the general superficial nature of humans. She hopes it will get people to examine the roots of the unhealthy biases and standards that manifest in their love lives. </p>

                <div class="mySlides fade" >
                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">But even if social critique isn’t your thing, at least you’ll still be entertained. </p>

                <div class="mySlides fade">
                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">The Premise: <br><br> A single woman just wants to find one person with whom she’d like to go on a second date. <br><br> That’s it. That’s the goal.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mySlides fade" >
                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">The Process: <br><br> As the woman engages in a series of activities with a pre-selected pool of 5 candidates, the audience will offer real-time feedback and vote via a chat platform specially created for the show to help her winnow the pool down to 2 candidates. Then she chooses which of the 2 remaining candidates gets the second date.</p>

                <div class="mySlides fade" >
                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">The Platforms: <br><br> This website is full of ancillary engagement tools intended to help with promoting and enhancing the show. It’s where each company that produces this play can create their own Dating Comprehension Universe by uploading (pre-scripted) “audition videos” for the daters on which the audience can comment. It’s also where folks who purchase a ticket can watch a livestream of a performance, comment on what they’re seeing, and vote to decide who advances to the next round.  </p>

                <div class="mySlides fade" >
                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">Bonus: <br><br> At the live performances, the participants can fill out a compatibility quiz for a chance to be live-matched with someone else in the audience. The producing company can even offer them a mini-date at the end of the show.  </p>

                    <div class="numbertext"></div>
                    <p class="slideText">It’s all game. And scalable. And hella gimmicky. But if that’s what it takes to get people out of their post-pandemic hidey-holes and connecting with each other in fun and potentially meaningful ways, maybe even thinking more deeply about the social implications of shit, then that’s a game worth playing. </p>
